#Omega File Manager
## A Web FileManager
I created this project for 2 reasons:
* build a file manager to use in another project.
* make some code with NodeJS

This file manager is able to:
* explore a filesystem
* download files through a web interface

## Installation
You need nodejs installed: I used the 5.2.0 version
* clone the repository git clone https://github.com/crazycoder1999/OmegaWebExplorer
* go in the cloned directory and install the dependency with **npm install**
* edit the Config.js file and configure the rootPath: it will be use as the root point.
* run the application with **node app.js**
* open the browser on http://127.0.0.1:8000

The software is tested on OSX...but it should run on Linux too.
